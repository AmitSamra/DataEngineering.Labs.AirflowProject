Amazon provides a tool that allows you to generage reports for your account, namely order history. In this project, I will search through my Amazon purchase history to determine if there are any trends. For example, is there any seasonality in my purchases by month of the year or day of the month? How much do I spend on electronic versus non-electronic items? What kind of shipping services does Amazon use for my oders and does it depend on the price of the item? Are the majority of the items that buy in a certain price range? By these questions and many more, I hope to uncover some of the mysteries of Amazon.
